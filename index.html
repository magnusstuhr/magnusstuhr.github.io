<p>My name is Magnus Stuhr and I hold a master's degree in Information Science from the University of Bergen. I am mainly a programmer, but I have held a variety of roles throughout my career. I have been involved in several projects in the private and public sectors, both for the industry and academia.</p>

<p>I like to share ideas and thoughts with others, which is why I have conducted research resulting in two journal publications, as well as holding several presentations and workshops both in Norway and abroad.</p>

<p>I am the leader of the Semantic Technologies group on Meetup.com, and are passionate about semantic technologies and how these technologies can effectively be integrated with business logic in any system and knowledge domain. I also love programming in general, and are fond of having excellent test-coverage and applying best-practices to my code.</p>
